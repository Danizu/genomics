### **Genomic sequence with Biopython and IBM Watson Studio**

​

I use IBM Watson Studio to build Jupyter Notebook for Machine Learning and Deep Learning models but 
I didn’t had the opportunity to write a Notebook to analyze genomic sequence. So two days ago I discovered 
this new (for me) world of genomic data. First of all working with genomic data means that you have to 
manage particular file type such as “fasta” and “Genbank” file. Fortunately I discovered Biopython and an 
online tutorial that was a game changer for me: http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html

 

This is the Notebook that, following a subset of Biopython tutorial, I prepared in IBM Watson Studio using 
Python V2.7 and a Jupyther Notebook.
